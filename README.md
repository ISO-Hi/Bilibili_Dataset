I used a webdriver from the selenium package (simply run pip install selenium in terminal) because some websites use JavaScript to dynamically load content after the initial HTML is loaded. I used Safari WebDriver. However, for Windows users, it is necessary to change to webdriver to ChromeDriver or Microsoft Edge WebDriver to scrape the websites.
